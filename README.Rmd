# Tree biomass estimates

The `HBEFBiomass` function uses localized equations to estimate above-ground tree biomass. See "Background information for tree biomass estimations" below for further details. 

## :eight_spoked_asterisk: `HBEFBiomass( )`

### Inputs

1. `data_type` Specifies whether the data of interest are internal to the package (meaning the clean, archived tree data from Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest for all watersheds, plots, and years) or external to the package (meaning data provided by the user). Must be set to "internal" or "external". The default is set to "internal".

2. `external_data` Only required if data_type is set to "external." A dataframe or tibble. Each row must be an observation of an individual tree. Must have at least these columns (column names are exact): 

    * **watershed:** Must be a character variable. Describes the watershed in which the data were collected. 
    
    * **year:** Must be a character variable. Describes the year in which the data were collected. 
    
    * **plot:** Must be a character variable. Identifies the plot in which the individual tree was measured.
    
    * **forest_type:** This column is OPTIONAL. If included, must be a character variable. Identifies the type of forest where the plot is located (for Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, forest type would be either northern hardwood or spruce-fir).
        
    * **elev_m:** Must be a numeric variable. Elevation in meters above sea level for the plot. 
            
    * **exp_factor:** Must be a numeric variable. The expansion factor specifies the number of trees per hectare that a given plot tree represents. 
    
    * **species:** Must be a character variable. Specifies the species of the individual tree. Must follow our four-letter species code naming conventions (see "Species code tables" in "Background information for tree biomass estimations" below).
    
    * **status:** Must be a character variable. Specifies whether the individual tree is alive ("Live") or dead ("Dead").
    
    * **vigor:** Must be a character variable. For live trees, the vigor should be 0, 1, 2, or 3 (see "Vigor code table" section in "Background information for tree biomass estimations" below). For standing dead trees, the vigor should be 4 or 5.
    
    * **dbh_cm:** Must be a numeric variable. Provides the diameter at breast height (DBH) of the individual tree in centimeters. 

3. `results` Specifies whether the results will be summarized by tree, by plot, or by plot as well as size class (size class has two categories: (1) tree, DBH >= 10 cm and (2) sapling, DBH < 10 cm). Must be set to either "by_tree", "by_plot", or "by_size". The default is set to "by_plot". 

### Outputs

A dataframe. The columns of the output dataframe depend on the results setting. 

* by_tree: 
    * All columns described above in external_data. 
    * **ht_cm:** Predicted height of the individual tree in centimeters.
    * **above_kg:** Above-ground tree biomass (including all wood, bark, branch, and foliage) in kilograms.
    * **leaf_kg:** Tree foliage biomass in kilograms.
    * Any additional (not required) columns in the input dataframe will remain in the output dataframe. 

* by_plot: 
    * **watershed:** As described above in external_data.
    * **year:** As described above in external_data.
    * **plot:** As described above in external_data.
    * **forest_type:** As described above in external_data.
    * **elev_m:** As described above in external_data.
    * **above_L_Mg_ha:** Above-ground live tree biomass (including all wood, bark, branch, and foliage) in megagrams per hectare.
    * **above_D_Mg_ha:** Above-ground dead tree biomass (including all wood, bark, branch) in megagrams per hectare.
    * **above_Mg_ha:** Above-ground (live + dead) tree biomass (including all wood, bark, branch, and foliage) in megagrams per hectare.
    * **leaf_Mg_ha:** Tree foliage biomass in megagrams per hectare.
  
* by_size: 
    * All columns described above in by_plot.
    * **sample_class:** Either tree (DBH >= 10 cm) or sapling (DBH < 10 cm).

### Demonstrations

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(HubbardBrookForestAnalytics)
```

**Results summarized by tree (using internal data):**
```{r}
# call the HBEFBiomass() function
internal_demo_1 <- HBEFBiomass(data_type = "internal",
                               results = "by_tree")

head(internal_demo_1)
```

*Notice in the output dataframe: The `bbd`, `canopy`, `elev_band`, `forest_type`, and `plot_area_ha` columns, which are additional (not required) columns in the internal dataframe, remain in the output dataframe. Any additional columns in the internal or external dataframe will remain in the output dataframe.*

<br>

**Results summarized by plot (using external data):**
```{r}
# investigate input external dataframe
external_demo_data
```

*Notice in the input dataframe: The plot without trees (W6, 1997, plot 2) is represented by species = "NONE". Watershed, year, plot, elev_m, and exp_factor are filled in as appropriate. All tree-level variables (i.e., status, vigor, dbh_cm) are NA.*

<br>

```{r}
# call the HBEFBiomass() function
internal_demo_2 <- HBEFBiomass(data_type = "external",
                               external_data = external_demo_data,
                               results = "by_plot")

internal_demo_2
```

*Notice in the output dataframe: The plot without trees (W6, 1997, plot 2) has 0 Mg/ha in all biomass columns.*

<br>

**Results summarized by plot as well as by size (using internal data):**
```{r}
# call the HBEFBiomass() function
internal_demo_3 <- HBEFBiomass(data_type = "internal",
                               results = "by_size")

head(internal_demo_3)
```

*Notice in the output dataframe: Since forest_type is included in the internal data, it is carried through into the summarized output data. The same idea applies to external data - if forest_type is included in the input dataframe, it will be carried through into the summarized output data.*

# Background information for tree biomass estimations

## Biomass workflow

**Step 1: Predict tree heights**

We fit new equations to predict height based on species, DBH, and elevation. These equations were fit using valley-wide height samples. 

**Step 2. Calculate above-ground live tree biomass**

We fit new equations to predict total above-ground tree biomass (including all wood, bark, branch, and foliage). We fit separate equations to predict tree foliage biomass on its own. 

**Step 3. Discount above-ground tree biomass for dead trees**

Standing dead trees lose mass in two ways: (1) they degrade with pieces falling and transferring to other biomass pools (e.g., stem tops break and become coarse woody debris) and (2) the remaining structures decay as measured by their density (i.e., mass/volume). We accounted for the decay and degrade of standing dead trees by discounting the live biomass estimates based on vigor. For trees/saplings with a vigor code of 4, the discount rate is 0.7283 (above-ground live tree biomass x 0.7283). For trees/saplings with a vigor code of 5, the discount rate is 0.5683 (above-ground live tree biomass x 0.5683).
